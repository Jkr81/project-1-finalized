      <h2>About Rocky</h2>
      <p>Rocky loves to sleep all day and jump on the funiture when no one 
        is looking. After every meal, he heads to the front of the couch 
    and starts to roll and run around the house. He might be crazy but is adorable 
in the process.  </p>
<h2>Favorite activities</h2>
      <p>Rocky loves to walk around the lake for about 20 minutes
        and interact with his friends along the way. He enjoys chasing down 
        squirrels and runing after ducks. And when in an extra playful mood, he runs away from
        his owners as they try to catch him. In a family of 5, he is the main attraction.
